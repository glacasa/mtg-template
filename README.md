## Installation (for local development)
1. For first time user, you have to install Ruby and NodeJS. You may follow my installation guide in my [Jekyll tutorial](http://melvinchng.github.io/jekyll/installation.html#ruby-and-nodejs-installation) or [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://melvinchng.github.io/jekyll/RubyOnRailsInstallation.html) for Windows, Linux, and MacOS (installation videos are included).
2. Install Jekyll by using the command `gem install jekyll`.
3. Then, install Jekyll Sitemap and Jekyll SEO gems by using the command `gem install jekyll-sitemap` and `gem install jekyll-seo-tag`.
4. Start your localhost server by using the command `jekyll serve`. Make sure that you are at the root directory of your folder before using this command.
5. Your site should be accessible at `localhost:4000`.
6. For additional information about Jekyll, refer to the [official website](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

_Note: If you forked it and edited `_config.yml` via the online editor on Github, the Github pages may not work. In that case, you will make any changes (add a new line, etc) and push the changes from your local machine via CLI or GUI git._

## Enjoy!
